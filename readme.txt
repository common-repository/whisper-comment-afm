Whisper Comment is a WordPress plugin for commenters to control comment visibility for other viewers.

== Description ==

Whisper Comment is a WordPress plugin for commenters to control comment visibility for other viewers. A 'whisper' is a comment that is only displayed for targeted viewers. Viewers who are not authorised to view the whisper, will only see the replacement text instead.

Inspired by the original [Whisper](http://lordchaos.dominatus.net/wordpress-plugin-whisper "Whisper by lordchaos") plugin, the new Whisper Comment is a brand new version for WordPress 2.7.

Other than English, the plugin has been translated to Traditional Chinese ([Chinese plugin homepage](http://www.anubisfrommemphis.com/laboratory/whisper-comment/ "Whisper Comment by Anubis From Memphis")). If you have any questions or suggestions, please leave comments through the plugin forum or at the plugin homepages.
